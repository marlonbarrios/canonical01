Performance with app by Laura V Ward and VIP guest

# Canonical 
The computer recomposes time and space creating and generating always new space-time loops and rhythms. Pachebel's canon in D is offered 
as a meta-logical pattern and a context for image recomposition with repetitions, juxtapositions and counterpoints.
The app also allows you to play and stop the music. The user also may record the video and sound of the performance pressinf a button. When the redording is stopped a download button appears and when pressed the video file is downloaded to the local computer.

Enjoy the space here:
It works better in Chrome and brave (not so well in safari).

## Soft Spaces:

It is series of classic video processing algorithms that uses the webcam input as a source and the browser as performance space; 
it helps us to rediscover the affordances of movement and perception augmented by computational systems and strategies. The space of
the frame is choreographed and remapped in coupling with user/performer. Soft Spaces represent the cognitive continuity of software, 
interface and embodiment. They are invitations to create and compose. How do they make us move?" 

Created for MotionDAO experiments in NFTs that invite to move.

INVITATION TO DACERS AND MOVERS:
I would love to create a collection of performances within these softwar spaces for an online exhibition.
